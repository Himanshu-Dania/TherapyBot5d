Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can't get stuck in them. usr: That's a good idea. I don't have many friends left, close friends that is, and this guy is my best friend of 20 years. We were in a touring rock band together. He's my last close friend. sys(Reflection of feelings, Self-disclosure): It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list -- perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn't easy, but it's part of maturing in life. usr: I'm a single dad so my world is my children. I guess that's enough for me really. I just watch this guy sink and often feel like I should be doing something, but I think you're right.",['Self-disclosure']

Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast...then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop. sys(Question): Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else ? usr: It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent usr: Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes. sys(Question): Have you talked since then? usr: We have talked a little bit before hand this month. It was okay but I am still sad about what happened She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn't ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety sys(Providing Suggestions): If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision usr: I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her. sys(Providing Suggestions, Question): I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don't be in a hurry to get into a new relationship , but if one happens that would be great too. Is this your first breakup? usr: I will definitely try to get over her using those techniques you just said. It's way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me sys(Reflection of feelings): Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on usr: Maybe you're right! Just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent sys(Providing Suggestions): I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities usr: I will definitely try. I know it will be hard because I am upset still but sometimes I guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation sys(Providing Suggestions): The sadness will eventually pass and I am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you usr: Awww I hope so. Just like some people say...there are plenty of fish in the sea. Thank you for the advice. It was really helpful.",['Reflection of feelings']

How do you feel about that? usr: I feel okay about that. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Well, it's worth a try, right! usr: Yes, it is worth a try. Thank you for all of your help!",['Others']

Maybe I can research something and see if there is anything new we can do together. sys(Providing Suggestions, Providing Suggestions): Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity. usr: That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Question): You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you? usr: Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22. sys(Question): Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis? usr: Yes but less over the past few months. sys(Providing Suggestions, Providing Suggestions, Question, Reflection of feelings): Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life. Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other. usr: That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first. sys(Providing Suggestions): How do you all generally communicate? Through text? usr: He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. sys(Question): Which do you and your man like to communicate? usr: No live together so we use call, text, and see each other in person. I communicate much more than he does. Thats why I think he is hiding something. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot. usr: You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. sys(Providing Suggestions): I would ask his fellow students, if you know any of them if they think he really loves you. usr: Do you think getting other people involved is a good idea? sys(Providing Suggestions, Providing Suggestions): I would be subtle about that tactic. If you haven't met any of his school mates. I wouldn't pursue that option. Have you met any of his class mates? usr: Yeah he has a few close friends but he is pretty to himself. We both live far away from home. sys(Question): Are you and him directly off campuses in housing? You both attend the same college, correct? usr: Yes off campus. Same college. sys(Question, Question, Reflection of feelings): Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating? Seen the customer before? Was it a man or woman who dropped the shocking news? I feel that the customer may have a case of mistaken identity indeed. usr: I work at a bar part time to support may way through school. It was a women. I know her, but not well. Met a few times around school.",['Reflection of feelings']

I wanted to have children with him and he refused but now I hear he is expecting a baby with another woman. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): a relationship is part of who you are. it isn't you usr: But it is very difficult to try to strike out on my own again and I do not know if I even want to. sys(Providing Suggestions): it is hard. it sucks. but the voyage through the suck is going to be better for you than you may realize right now usr: But I feel that I am facing middle age on my own and I really do not want to do that. sys(Providing Suggestions): you have survived 14 days without a bad relationship. keep on doing that day by day and before you know it, you will be on the other side of the bad feelings usr: What happens if I just can't ever get over it though? Right now it's hard to see any sort of way through these feelings. sys(Information): yes, middle age is scary, but there are so many things you can do. ageism is out usr: I feel I might have missed out on my chance to have a family of my own though, because I waited fifteen years and my partner would not go for that. sys(Providing Suggestions): please watch the cartoon animals and brene brown on youtube talk about empathy. find one of your friends who has been through the suck and let them help you find your path out. usr: Most of my friends seem to be very happily coupled up right now. They are sympathetic but they do not really understand. sys(Self-disclosure): i had an emergency ovary removal in my early 30s and didn't know if i woudl be able to have children. my doctor told me that the most important thing i could do was to be healthy becuse a healthy mother was what i could give my children even if i adopted them usr: That sounds like very good advice from both you and your doctor. It is a difficult thing to have to confront though. I really do appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to talk honestly with me. sys(Providing Suggestions): you want an empathetic friend. nobody has gone through the exact same thing you have but the emotions are common ones. you will be ok, even if you dont feel that way now usr: I hope that I will but am not sure. I really do feel rather better about things now though but - there's a long way to go. Thank you so much for your support!",['Others']

Money is not an issue for you guys? usr: nope not at all. hmm well she does ask to use my credit card alot. my parents foot the bill. sys(Providing Suggestions): Perhaps you should try to talk to your parents around this fact.

Perhaps it will be better to talk to them with another person present. usr: That's a great idiea. i will bring my g.f or is that a bad idea? sys(Providing Suggestions): If another person is present, it may make it easier. However, I believe it should be someone that is not invovled in this issue. Perhaps another family member or a close family friend. usr: gotcha. i will bring my good friend. i'm sure he can help me out. great advice by the way. i'm so mad though why my parents care who i date. man i'm old enough. let me make my choices sys(Information): Parents have a difficult time understanding their child at times. Hopefully, through this you all can become closer. usr: Thank you it will. will talk to them this weeked with a friend present. wish me luck :)","['Self-disclosure', 'Others']"

I've been looking for a job for months, but feel like I'm getting nowhere. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): I'm sorry to hear that but if i may hear your you clearly, what you are saying is that you don't have any job for a long time now usr: Well, I am fortunate to have a job, but I am seeking a different job because the one I have does not pay what my skills are worth. It barely pays enough for me to pay my essential bills. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Question): ok, that is a bit of relief have u check for job vacancy in your state usr: I have, but there are few decent jobs out there. Most available jobs are in locations where one can not drive safely or their personal safety is at risk. sys(Reflection of feelings): oh, safety is everything. have you ever consider changing your location. i once change my location to pursue my goal and it pan out well usr: Last week, I submitted an application package for my dream job. I have over 15 years of experience and the employer offers housing (which I have seen before, and it is quite nice). I have heard nothing at all. I would have to relocate 4 hours away, but I would do it in a heartbeat for this job. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): wow, i pray that work out. i believe it will work out usr: What makes this job so special to me is that it is not like a regular job: it is at a conference center resort owned by my church denomination. I have attended religious retreats there and am now in the process of seeking a new confirmation into this church because it is a different church than that of my childhood. Working there would be ministry, not typical work. And because the majority of staff and guests are from one of our sister churches, one is working mostly with friends and building long relationships. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): wow, that's a big deal. i know you might not be the only one fighting for this position but i trust you will get it usr: Thank you. I believe there are three things in my favor: I know the job well, as I became friends with the person I would be replacing, My pastor wrote a glowing reference, and I was also able to get a reference from the person who trained me for my current (related) job fifteen years ago. sys(Information): even by working there, you will surely meet new friends. do you know many people from the church? usr: We worked together for almost 13 years before she retired, but who would be in a better position to assess my skill than my trainer/work partner?

And though everyone has a role, the office staff support each other well and work as a team. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): wow, banquet at work. that is a wonderland stuff usr: At the risk of preaching religion, I believe God may be calling me to serve there. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Affirmation and Reassurance): that is definitely a dream job. God is everywhere just put your trust in Him. He never sleep nor slumber usr: When off duty, staff are encouraged to enjoy the facilities and mingle with guests.

It would feel like a family reunion, but in a family where everyone gets along. sys(Reflection of feelings): that is good, i work in such place where everyone is like a family. usr: The music events year round are outstanding. They have many well known names in Christian music as well as speakers who are well worth hearing. To be able to hear these messages at no cost makes the job priceless. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): i can feel your excitement. usr: As I said to my pastor, just to work somewhere where people say thank you and ask how you are doing rather than criticize every move would be such a blessing. And since I work nights already, I am more than happy to cover the office overnight to attend to guests who have locked themselves out, or have other concerns.

"usr: My boyfriend broke up with me. sys(Question): Hello there, how are you? usr: I'm very upset. He yelled and yelled at me. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing, Affirmation and Reassurance): Your relationship has ended? I am very sorry about that. And your boyfriend ended it? That was really wrong of him if you ask me. I think you might be better off without him. usr: Yes, after seeing him act this way I agree He said I was worthless. sys(Self-disclosure): I have been in this position myself and I know how painful it is but it turned out for the best for me - I now have a great relationship! usr: Well that's good for you, but I'm so mad right now I can't see straight! sys(Others): Noone has the right to put you down like that. You really are better off without him. usr: I know. I do deserve better. But I was with him a very long time. sys(Others, Question): Can you think of something to do that will take your mind off him? How long were the two of you together? usr: More than a year, but I've known him since childhood. That's what makes me so mad! sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): He should not be treating you that way when you've known one another so long! usr: All those years of friendship down the drain. Should I call him? sys(Others): I think that you should call one of your girlfriends and suggest you have a movie night. It would make you feel better usr: But all of my friends are still friends with him! And they took his side! sys(Others): Oh that is rough. That happened to me too when I broke up with my ex. usr: How did you get through it? sys(Question): They all took his side? Not one took yours? usr: Not one! sys(Self-disclosure): I tried to find some new interests. One thing I did was take a salsa class .. that was a great way to meet new people usr: I'm not much of a dancer, but that might be a way to meet new people. sys(Others): There are lots of other things you could do. Maybe you could take an evening class in something that interests you? usr: He's a teacher, so taking a class might remind me of him. sys(Providing Suggestions): I think also you need to think a bit more highly of yourself and not let idiots like this treat you so badly usr: But maybe I deserved it. sys(Others): he seems to have damaged your self esteem badly usr: Yes, he did. sys(Providing Suggestions): No you did not! Please don't think like that usr: I'm just so angry that I could break something. And maybe I will do that! sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Information): I think that that is a normal reaction to feeling ill treated. I hope that it will pass soon and am sure that it will.

Is there anything else you would like to talk about? usr: Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing sys(Providing Suggestions): I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I'm sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all. usr: yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum . I do appreciate the advice and ideas sys(Others): Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number, we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away. usr: And appreciate that especially during the current situation. sys(Others): Your welcome stay strong. usr: You as well. sys(Others): Thank you. usr: Oh I did want to ask. do you have any experience in either Alaska or Arizona? I know vastly differnt places but when I move I had been considering those. among others. Alska seems so risky but potentially amazing but it is rather far away from ""main america""",['Others']
