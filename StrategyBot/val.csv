Or is it more a case of just not feeling rested after your sleep? usr: I mostly work and go to school during the day so there really isn't too much time unless I decide to exorcise early in the morning. By the end of the day, I already feel exhausted from work and most of my motivation to exorcise is gone. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I see. Sleep problems are very common you certainly aren't alone in this. With some changes I am confidant you can improve your sleep. usr: Do you have any suggestions other than exorcising to help with sleeping? Anything would be taken into consideration if possible. sys(Providing Suggestions, Self-disclosure, Providing Suggestions): I listen to a really good podcast called Tracks to Relax. It's guided meditation that helps me deeply relax before I sleep. sometimes I use it in the middle of the night too, if I can't fall back asleep! Have you tried meditation before bed? usr: Oh wow, I never really thought listening to relaxing music to help go back to sleep. I will try that out tonight! I have never done meditation before bed, mostly during the day. sys(Providing Suggestions): Is your room dark? Light blocking curtains can help. usr: Its decently covered and at night it is pretty dark. sys(Providing Suggestions): And a small snack of carbs, like a peice of toast or some cereal, before bed can help too. As you can see I have tried many things myself as I too have had sleep issues. usr: I will try that out as well if listening to relaxing sounds doesn't help. Thank you very much for responding to my questions and needs! sys(Reflection of feelings, Others): I certainly know how feeling tired can impact one's life, I have found it frustrating when I have a lot to do and just don't have the energy. You are very welcome, it's been a pleasure talking with you :) usr: Likewise, Thank you again! I hope you have a wonderful day/evening!",['Others']

But I see the struggle is finding a way to get there. usr: Yeah she is a good friend im happy that I can stay with her for the time being its just stressful trying to get to my mom sys(Providing Suggestions): If you are struggling on finding a way back to your moms house, it might be a good idea to loan or borrow some money from either friends or family, or open a credit card just for the time being. Then once you get back to your mom's, you can start focusing on yourself and get yourself back on your feet! IT's important to not overwhelm yourself right now, so focus on one thing at a time usr: Yeah I definitely agree. I am waiting to hear back from capitalone about getting approved for a credit card and my friend said she can loan me 70$ but the bus ticket to my mom is 150$ so I'm almost to my goal I'm working on it though. It does make me feel better to talk about it though and lay it all out it makes it easier to figure my stuff out sys(Reflection of feelings, Affirmation and Reassurance): That is great to hear! I know that you are probably also hurting from the breakup itself too, but I'm glad to hear that you are focusing on getting yourself to a safe place first. It's going to take a long time to fully heal again, but as long as you make sure you are stable, you will be able to get through this It also sounds like you know what you need to do, and you aren't letting yourself forget what is important. That is wonderful usr: Yeah thanks I appreciate that. I feel a lot better I hope you have an awesome day! I do understand what I need to do for sure It was just overwhelming thinking about everything and talking it and listing it out makes me feel better for sure",['Affirmation and Reassurance']

You could also help them find a job, too. Put a favor in the favor bank. usr: I have contacts in the previous job location only. But not in my family location. Some of my friends in the previous location have given some idea what I can do. To find a job in my previous location is not an issue. I try to be nearby. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): Ok. So in a way, you need to build a new network of industry contacts nearby. Is there an industry group or other club in the area? usr: I am worried if it will help or I have to switch to my distant locaion only. sys(Question): How much time can you wait? Time seems to be the gating factor here. usr: Since my wife is working, I do not have a time limitation to find a job. My worry is whether I have to be distant again, while pandemic has not ended. sys(Reflection of feelings): Ok. You think you'll have job opportunities, but maybe not ones that meet your location needs. Are you hoping to spend more time with your family? usr: Yes. Particularly in pandemic times. sys(Question): It sounds like you have a good handle on your situation. Is there anything else I can help you with? usr: In your opinion, Am I in the right path? sys(Information, Information): Yes. Time will help you resolve this issue. You will gain perspective on what's out there. More opportunities will come up if you have time to investigate. usr: We, I and my wife, also think the same way. Even if takes some time, better to wait. But we were having an oscillation. After chatting with you, we feel supportive of our thinkings. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): That's great! I'm glad I was able to help. usr: Now that we had enough discussion and had my worries clarified, Can I take a leave. Thank you for your help.",['Others']

"usr: Hi! sys(Question): Hello. How are you feeling today? usr: Well, I'm a little tired and anxious but I got use to it. And you? sys(Self-disclosure): I'm doing well, thanks for asking. Do you know what's might be causing these feelings of anxiety and fatigue? usr: Well, its very difficult to sleep because of the nightmares. Every time I sleep I have the same dream. I recall the event in my sleep and its just horrible. sys(Reflection of feelings): That must be very distressing to have the same nightmare every night. Do you have a nighttime routine to help you get to rest in a more relaxed state? usr: Yes, I read some magazines and some blogs on internet about some routines but they just don't help. sys(Self-disclosure): I'm sorry to hear that you haven't had success with routines. I have suffered with sleeplessness due to bad dreams as well. I find doing yoga with meditative breathing allows me to clear my mind, and sleep better. Do you practice any meditation? usr: I have never tried because I'm too anxious to stay still for longer periods of time. I mean I have tried but its not easy. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Having high anxiety makes it very hard to concentrate on meditation. I take a medication for anxiety that has helped me a lot. Have you talked to your doctor about your anxiety? usr: Yeah, they gave me pills for that but it didn't help me. I know its hard to help me, I just feel better by talking to someone. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Question): I'm really sorry you weren't able to get relief with medication. I understand that having someone to talk to can be a relief when you feel so anxious. Do you have any close friends or family that you can talk to more often? usr: Yeah I actually have my best friends and every time i feel horrible I talked to them. But sometimes its just difficult cause bringing the same issue over and over can be exhausting for them. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Question): I'm sure your friend is glad to be able to lend a listening ear. Sometimes we need to hash out our problems more than once to resolve them. Do you like to exercise? It can be a great way to relieve anxiety and exhaust your body so you sleep better. usr: Actually, yes. I do a lot of exercise and that actually helps me sleep a little. sys(Information, Question): I'm so glad to hear you have some outlet for your anxiety that helps with your sleep. Keeping your body healthy can be a great start to getting your mind in a more calm space. If you don't mind me asking, do you work a lot of hours outside your home? usr: No, I'm a student and with the pandemic and all that it's virtual but that keeps me busy. sys(Providing Suggestions): I see. Being at home alone most of the time, even when you have virtual meetings, may be contributing to your anxiety. Maybe you could meet up with friends in person at a park or other outdoor location. Is that possible? usr: Yeah, don't worry. I go out with my friends regularly. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): That's great! I'm glad you are getting plenty of socialization during this difficult time. usr: Thanks :D sys(Question): Do you like music? It can be a great way to wind down instead of looking at screens before bedtime. usr: I love music, it helps me disconnect from the world. You know, you help me a lot to release some stress, thank you. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Others): Wonderful! I'm so glad our conversation has helped you feel better.

I should learn a little more about how that works and see if that's an option. I'm not sure things could get much worse at this point. This could be my last ditch effort. That's good advice and you saying it directly to me makes me think I should lean into it. I can't just spin my wheels in misery much longer. sys(Others, Others): Anonymous reporting sounds like a good thing, as long as it's not being abused. This sounds like a very good time to use it though I hope I have been able to give you some good advice here! usr: Most definitely. I feel more confident now about the anonymous reporting. I'll gather some notes from my peers to ensure I have a viable complaint. That's so helpful. Thank you.",['Others']

THat's about it. with a wife and 2 kids, I don't have more time. sys(Others): Sometimes some of the best things we can do is t get out and away from all the things that WE as people have created. Get into the woods and throw a ball around. usr: That would be nice. Is that what you do when you are stressed or depressed? sys(Self-disclosure): I understand, especially having the remote learning going on, it is hard to get away from work and school. usr: Yeah. How do you cope with your stresses? I find myself drinking more than I want now too. sys(Self-disclosure): I try to, I love packing a day back with some easy snacks, and going out for a hike through the woods. Sometimes I use the state trails but sometimes I just go out and make my own new trail. usr: That's fun. I try to get out once a month for a nice hike. We did the Indiana Dunes last month and that was good. With the snow coming, it might be more snow shoeing moving forward. sys(Providing Suggestions): Well, drinking doesn't really deal with it. It only pushes things off for later to deal with. Exercising is a really good way to deal with that stress. usr: Yeah. I have not missed a workout since COVID-19 started. That seems to keep me grounded. sys(Self-disclosure): That's true! I used to live in Ohio, and the weather was amazing this time of year. usr: Yeah.

"usr: Hi, how are you? sys(Question): I good, how are you feeling? usr: I am worried that COVID-19 has made me depressed. I am usually a well mannered, even personality but I find myself impatient and possibly getting depressed. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): So you think that COVID-19 has made you depressed? Could there be anything else that could be bothering you? usr: Possibly... I think the remote learning of my kids and the iability to leave the house or go out, is making me sadder than normal. sys(Reflection of feelings): I completely understand where you are coming from there. I feel like remote learning takes away from some of the social aspects of life that need to happen in order for a healthy life. usr: I am also worried that I am not playing the political game well. I feel like I am too straight forward, not rude, but I should play politics more to get ahead. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Others): I understand that as well.

Running also releases endorphins into the body which will help to alleviate some of the drinking/stress. usr: I am trying to do more. I work out daily and that isgood but I am trying yoga for the second workout. Thanks for your help.",['Others']

"usr: hello, how're you? sys(Question): GOOD. What bring you here today usr: I'm feeling rather sad. I used to have a very close-knit group of friends, basically my best friends. We would talk all the time, hang out together, and basically just do everything together. Because of Covid, I've had to stay in my house and basically not associate with anyone else. My friends don't even try to talk to me anymore. I understand that life goes on without me, but they could at least try. They never even offered to wear a mask around me. They would make fun of me when I wore a mask. They didn't support my decisions when I was trying to still be a part of the group while also protecting my family (since they are all high risk) sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): So what I hear you saying is that since COVID your friends won't talk to you and that they make fun of you for wanting to wear a mask and protect yourself? usr: Yes. Sure they've tried to stay in touch but it's always me starting the conversation. Or if they start it, it only involves ""hi how're you, good how're you,"" and then the conversation ends. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I am sorry to hear that your friends have been so distant lately. Have you tried to ask them why they have been this way? usr: Yes. They say that because I'm not hanging out with them physically, it's hard. They also say that I don't put effort into conversations when I feel like I am the only one putting in effort (which I have stated and they have said I don't). sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): So what I hear you saying is that they have backed away from you because you have chosen to take precautions due to COVID and they are choosing to not? Is that correct? usr: Yes this is correct. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Well you are being smart by doing the right thing and protecting yourself and others during this time. You should not feel bad about what you are doing. usr: Thank you. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to keep reaching out when I don't feel like they actually want to keep in contact with me. I know we could still get along well, but it's hard when I'm the only one to make the effort. sys(Question): Do you have any other friends besides this group? Do you have other people that you could reach out to that are social distancing that you could relate to more during this time that you would have more in common with right now? usr: I have very few that have similar thoughts as me that I have tried to reach out to. But most of them have their own lives, boyfriends/girlfriends, and things they do. Mostly everyone seems to be hanging out with people which leaves me physically left out. sys(Question): What hobbies or activities do you like to do? usr: I play field hockey so I train a lot in my basement (because I'm scared to go out to the gym), I listen to music, read, watch Christmas movies, and I love talking to people. Honestly, I'm okay. I have my family and other things to occupy my time.

I'm trying to stay positive, but it's hard some days! As much as I try to start the day in a positive frame of mind it quickly gets sucked out of me! sys(Others): What do you do outside of work? Hobbies and such. usr: At the moment I'm not getting outside as much as I should, I do enjoy gaming but it's hard to find time. I've been working 14 hour days all week! My boyfriend tries to tell me to switch off but it's hard when I know there's all this work waiting to be done. sys(Providing Suggestions, Providing Suggestions, Others): You could try setting aside an evening or two a week for time with your BF. Just walk out of the office. Try to set some boundaries. That might seem dangerous and risky, but sometimes it's important to set boundaries. If you don't do that, then the managers can just keep taking advantage of you and your work ethic. usr: Yeah, he says the same kind of thing, that I need to be firmer and just leave when I'm due to. I guess the only way for them to truely see is for the work to just not get done as there's no time! sys(Others): From what you're saying, it sounds like you think you have no power. Is that true? Are you really powerless in this situation? Do not underestimate your power over your life. usr: I guess I do feel powerless, I feel like they never really listen to what I'm saying, they just act as if they are but then ignore me.",['Providing Suggestions']

I'm feeling super stressed about the workload I have, I just can't keep up with it all! sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I’m sorry to hear that. Work can be a bad source of stress. Do you have anyone that can help with the workload? usr: Not really, there's only me in my role so don't really have anyone to help. I have tried talking to my line manager but she doesn't seem to understand just how busy I am. sys(Providing Suggestions, Providing Suggestions): Can the company hire any more people? Maybe they can work from home, and take some work off your plate. The line manager might also need some help with her workload. I understand that budgets can be tight. Maybe someone part-time? usr: From what I hear they aren't willing to hire anyone else, but I don't know the reasons why. I can only speak to my line manager and then she speaks to higher management. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Providing Suggestions): Your manager sounds unsympathetic. That's very frustrating. A lot of people are in your situation in this pandemic: too much work, not enough help. Do you want to leave the company? Look for greener pastures? usr: I have been keeping an eye out for other jobs, but like you say things are difficult just now with the pandemic, there isn't a lot out there! sys(Providing Suggestions): Very true. Have you talked to your co-workers about this issue? What do they think? usr: They are all feeling stretched as well so they understand. I am trying to not talk about it too much with them, I don't want to be seen as the person who's always complaining! sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing, Affirmation and Reassurance): Yeah, that's a good point.

If they listen to you, it encourages you to complain. If they ignore you, you go away and leave them alone. However, if you leave work early (after 9 hours, say), then they might notice you. Are you willing to take a risk? usr: Maybe if I start acting more confidently they will start to listen.

Do you have anyone who either shares the same opinion as you or does not know your friend that you can talk to? usr: My other friend believed that it wasn't too harsh to end the friendship as they know I value honesty but it makes me feel angry that I was being used for so long and constantly lied to. sys(Providing Suggestions): You have every right to be angry, but the most important thing you can do is find a good support system with your other friend. It will take some time to heal, but I'll tell you a paraphrased version of one of my favorite quotes: ""Resentment is like swallowing poison and expecting the other person to die."" It's important to find support in your other friends and heal properly. usr: I really love that quote, it's absolutely true; I think I will talk to my friend about the situation some more so I can fully get over it. sys(Others): That sounds like a wonderful idea.

Earlier you said you and your friend were arguing while she was living in your house, then she stopped talking to you. Why might you be angry with yourself? usr: Because I basically allowed her to use me for seven years and kept lying to me or gave her space because I thought I was being a good friend. I feel like I was stupid to do that and soft sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Affirmation and Reassurance): If I may, I would argue that your actions don't make you soft and they certainly don't make you stupid. They are certainly not any reason to be angry with yourself. If I may bring up another cliché: ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me."" I would say you're in the ""fool me once"" stage and it is your friend's actions that have brought you pain. I think you're unlikely to trust her again. Also, hindsight is 20/20. What you might see now in ways that your friend might have used you are things that you might not have seen then. We want to think the best of our friends until they prove us wrong.

I know how it feels to have that sense of betrayal from a friend I was close to for many years. However, I was able to discuss the issue I had with my parents and other friends.

Try to say some more about that if you can. Thanks, I hope the same for you. usr: I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing, Restatement or Paraphrasing): Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives. Well said. You feel stuck. The usual things you would do now are just not available to you. usr: yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now. yes correct Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should). So I am disappointed in myself to say the least. and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way. usr: now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling. usr: yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening. sys(Question): Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them? usr: We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come. I thought about that sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves. usr: to the gym, I certainly would. Because it's indoors and I do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running I felt that way because the path that I usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, I did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But I finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business. but that's just me, and I know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc. sys(Question): Have you ever heard of the phrase ""black or white thinking?"" As in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible? usr: so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety.

So I am disappointed in myself to say the least. and also feeling guilty to see myself waste my life and time this way and not being productive sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): I can rephrase some of this, if you don't mind. In a way, you're talking about activities that you may have used (gym, hikes, etc) to keep yourself in a good mood. Now that those don't seem available, you just don't have those opportunities to boost your mood. It makes sense that you would be feeling this way. usr: now I am more used to it of course, but this summarizes how I have been feeling for most of this year. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I think you explained yourself really well. Thanks for sharing how you've been feeling. usr: yes you're right. That's exactly it. I think it's going to be this way for a long time. I see other people compromising and taking the risk to go out for walks or runs, and even to the gym. I could have done that for the last few months when we had zero cases for awhile, but I didn't want to gamble and compromise. And I still see those people as selfish when I choose to do what I think is right. yeah no worries. It's good that you understand and thank you for listening. sys(Question): Do you think if you went ahead anyway to the gym or out for runs that you would feel guilty for doing them? usr: We won't know more about the mental implications and the sociological aspects of the pandemic probably until years to come. I thought about that sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): Yeah, and that just throws on another layer of why things are difficult right now. No one wants to feel guilty for doing things that could help themselves. usr: to the gym, I certainly would. Because it's indoors and I do feel it's unsafe as there are many equipment that others could touch. Running I felt that way because the path that I usually run on is narrow and other people walk through it also. However, I did have second thoughts about that when the case numbers were down. But I finally decided to keep doing it and stick to all outdoor trips for essential business. but that's just me, and I know we all have different personalities, preferences, and tolerances of risks and acceptances, etc. sys(Question): Have you ever heard of the phrase ""black or white thinking?"" As in, thinking that situations or people are completely good or completely bad? Or completely doable or completely impossible? usr: so in my opinion, I feel a little indignant at the people that have been going out frivolously like there's nothing going on, to even gamble their safety and their family's. Like I live in an apartment building, and the people around me and below me are always going out, even for the last few months. So I don't feel safe either but also indignant that others are doing what I could have done, but that I had compromised on for my safety and everyone else's safety. So I just didn't feel it was fair for them to do that when I could have done that anytime I wanted. black and white thinking...let me think for this pandemic, it's pretty much black and white sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Yeah, I think I understand that too. I get really frustrated hearing about people hosting big parties or not wearing masks because they think it's no big deal. They're putting others at risk. usr: Because I either go out or I don't. I have to compromise my values and everything I worked hard to preserve for the last few months to go out, even if I put on extra protection etc. And I just rigidly refuse to compromise my values because I don't believe it's right. Because if I had done that, I would have done that already, and long ago. And even though it's really hard on me. yeah exactly. Because people are being selfish and are subjecting others to risks even if they don't care about themselves. but I know I am pretty extreme in my thinking. I really love the outdoors and I go out pretty often before the pandemic. But it's just that my own thinking is rigid and made up about it. But anyhow, that's the situation in a nutshell. sys(Information): I think we all do black-or-white thinking to some extent. We're wired to try and make sense of the world, and maybe our brains don't like to spend time on nuance and grey areas. We all tend to quickly categorize things into good or bad, easy or hard, black or white. usr: yeah I understand your thinking with the grey areas as well. I suppose for this case, it's all black and white for me, no grea areas or compromises. that's good analysis by the way. But anyhow I am good to go then. Thank you so very much for understanding and for your valuable inputs. sys(Question): Does this time have to be a ""waste"" for you? With no productivity? That seems pretty extreme. usr: it's a fascinating area though, fascinating thinking. I am also curious on the social and mental implications of this in the long-run but only time will tell there will be so much research and books written about our times. well I do a lot of ""waste"" at home. So I am quite sluggish and lazy and lost at home. sys(Providing Suggestions): Thanks for saying that! I liked talking with you, and we can wrap this up. I guess I'm saying you sound thoughtful and intelligent, I'm confident that you could find ways to get more out of this time if that's what you're wanting to do. usr: I am productive but not as driven or productive as before at home. for sure yeah. I am sure we can get through all this in one piece eventually. I was thinking this also that even though this is a very tough time, we will look back on this about years from now, and say wow, we got through all that! sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Not as productive? Of course! It's a pandemic. We all are. :) Hope you're not too hard on yourself right now. usr: no no I am okay thanks for asking I am just kind of spelling in out the details of my thinking and how my life has been so far I am actually okay so no worries sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Ha, exactly. Maybe we're not all thriving and getting rich and adding 15 pounds of muscle during this time. But we can get through it. usr: yup. Exactly. Lost time can always be made up later. okay then. I am good to go. Thanks again and thank you for your input. It does help to just kind of vent in a way. sys(Question): Before we quit, would you want to say one specific thing you know you can do today to help yourself out? usr: Yeah for sure I worked out a little bit before I started the chat. I am also doing some online courses on my own time. So I will keep working hard on those. And I hope to get back more into the routine of working out. I really do think it helps my mood if I just make more time and motivation for that. And you seem intelligent and analytical also and you know what I mean. So I do appreciate your time and input sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): Nice! Good job with those things. usr: thanks. I hope you best of luck then with all your endeavours. I know we can all get through this time. Thank you. stay well and stay safe my friend",['Affirmation and Reassurance']
"usr: Hello I am here to discuss my anxiety over the current pandemic. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Question): Hey there! That's a good topic to talk about. With everything that's been going on, it's normal to feel some anxiety. What do you think is one thing that is giving you a lot of anxiety? usr: Thank you very much for your understanding. Yeah it's tough especially with rising cases for the past two weeks or so in my city. I live in Canada and my city is pretty good so far and really low on numbers but have been seeing new cases every day for the last two weeks or so so that adds anxiety to me when I go out and I am more on guard and paranoid sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I'm sorry to hear that. Similar stuff is happening where I am, and I also get anxious hearing about it. usr: And we had a lock-down earlier this year and yet, with the exception of one province, every province remains operational at full speed despite lock-downs earlier, and now a lot of provinces are seeing record cases with the second wave. yeah I hope you get through this okay also and stay safe and well. sys(Question, Affirmation and Reassurance): What do you feel when you feel on guard and paranoid? Try to say some more about that if you can. Thanks, I hope the same for you. usr: I go out pretty much only when I have a purpose and personal admin/errands. I work about one or two days a week out of my home. So with the rising cases, I just feel anxious having to get out of the safety of my home. I was a lot more anxious earlier this year though. I am much more used to it at this time. And it's hard where everyday is the same for me and staying at home, without a change of pace like even simple walks outside, going to the gym, or going to hike or run etc. I pretty much missed out the whole year after March. My life has been on hold and I am just surprised that it's even november now, because it feels like I am still stuck in March. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing, Restatement or Paraphrasing): Yeah, that makes sense. When this was all new, the uncertainty probably made for more anxiety. Now that we know some more about what is safe and what isn't, maybe less so. But it doesn't mean the anxiety is gone, of course. It's still around in our day-to-day lives. Well said. You feel stuck. The usual things you would do now are just not available to you. usr: yeah I have been adjusting to it and the cases were down and even to zero in my city for most of the last few months, but there's definitely the start of a new community spread now. yes correct Plus there's a loss of routine or motivation. I procrastinate a lot and get lost in thought or lost without thought. I don't work out as much as I used to (inside or outside of home). I don't eat as well and my sleep pattern is not good at all (I sleep a lot later than I should).

No, I do well, it just causes me a great amount of stress. sys(Self-disclosure): I hear you, I have been in a similar situation.

Have you tried to tell her how you feel about her behaviour and attitude towards your studies? usr: Exactly. I feel like there is this society stereotype of needing straight A's otherwise you are a failure or something. A bit, but she uses the ""I pay for your education"" card.

Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful for her financial support, but she uses it to manipulate me at times. sys(Question): Are there any scholarships or hardship funds that you could potentially look into applying for? usr: Yes, I have received multiple scholarships, but nothing that will make a dent in the tuition. College is too expensive. sys(Self-disclosure): Ah, it is very expensive isn't it? I understand, I am still paying off my loans! But it should be worth it in the end.

I've seen a lot of men in relationships not be so committed for real, but just like the physical part. usr: yep. like my aunt said why pay for the milk when you can get the cow for free. i've done that for years and im getting tired of it. not to mention my libido is slowing down so i see things clearer sys(Reflection of feelings): Just from chatting with you, I see that you feel like you want more from the relationship and would like commitment on more than one level. usr: yes when it comes down to it. and i don't know if i will ever find it- especially these days. and i don't want to settle sys(Self-disclosure): I had to look for someone who was committed in all areas and only figured this out after making mistakes. I can see you have really shown maturity in learning from your experiences. usr: it's easy to settle when you're attracted to the guy. I have learned a lot from my past. I'm afraid the two might find out about each other. Not sure if it's a good thing or not sys(Information): From what I've seen having confidence in yourself and what you feel in your heart won't lie. usr: do you think it's good if they find out about each other? sometimes guys try harder when they know there is competition. sometimes it makes them run the other way sys(Information): Do you think one may have jealousy and get aggressive if he finds out? It's a personal decision that takes some thought. usr: honestly im not sure. there is always that risk when doing that with guys. i better think long and hard before doing that! sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): It sounds like you put a lot of thought into things which can be helpful in decision making. usr: i think so. keeps me out of some potential messes sys(Others): Can I help you with anything else? usr: not at the moment. thanks for your input! nity nite",['Others']

Are you sleeping okay at night? usr: I'm getting plenty of sleep, and I do practice meditation, maybe not as often as I should, I meditate five minutes per day sys(Providing Suggestions): I would suggest trying Mindfulness exercises for at least 15 minutes every day and see if that helps. usr: I'll see if that helps, I'm really low on energy right now because it just takes so much out of me sys(Information): I understand, Sometimes the Mindfulness exercises help me get more productive sleep. usr: I try to do mindfulness before bed, but I'm always too tired. I think it would be better if I did them in the afternoon at some point, did you use guided meditation? sys(Information): I did, ASMR guidance seems to help me most, but I happen to be ASMR sensative, perhaps you are as well? They seem to help with my anxiety as well. usr: Are those the videos on youtube where the sound is enhanced? Those are soothing sys(Others): Yes, Kind of like whispers, almost like Bob Ross on those old painting videos. usr: Just talking about my anxiety has helped a lot actually, and I do enjoy bob ross, hadn't thought of that as therapeutic but it makes sense sys(Reflection of feelings): I am glad I could be helpful. usr: Yes, thank you for your help Take care now!",['Reflection of feelings']

You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better? sys(Self-disclosure, Information): It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you. One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you. usr: I think I feel this way because I feel so stuck. I make a little money working remotely but not enough to make any big changes and the things I do don't ever last like the house is only clean for moments. You are right, one of my friends who has asthma started getting her meds through an online doctor and I am sure therapists are on line also, she said her doctor is even reasonable and less than her normal office visit that is something I can look into. sys(Providing Suggestions): I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete? usr: What would be an example of a smaller goal? Enjoy your son my kids are grown and gone and it happens faster than you think. sys(Providing Suggestions): Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things. usr: I don't really have big goals because they all seem too impossible to be realistic. Your small goals seem big to me. I can barely drag myself to the kitchen must let get motivated enough to clean it. sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter? usr: That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists? How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get help? sys(Information, Information): Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like ""Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale"" As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way. usr: Thank you things don't seem quite as hopeless now and I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. You have a nice day and I am going to go do that search now.",['Others']

I can't sleep and I'm insanely anxious all of the time. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I can feel your anxiety, and I completely understand why you're feeling that way, but you don't know for sure that will be true. Have you started looking for a new job already? usr: I started looking for a job last week. I had a transition meeting today to pass on the little bit of my work that will be left to another person. I have 2 children; one who just started college this fall and another who is a junior in high school. my elderly mother lives with me also so I can't sell my house any time soon and move into something smaller and cheaper. I feel really trapped at the moment. sys(Providing Suggestions): It definitely sounds like you're being overwhelmed with a lot of responsibilities along with your job loss. It's definitely a lot of things to deal with all at once, but it would help to break things down so they're more manageable. Do you have anyone close by who can help you out? usr: i have friends and family close by. i don't like to burden people with my problems. I know i also don't adjust well to change and that doesn't help. breaking issues down into groups is helpful and may take away some of the enormity of everything. sys(Self-disclosure, Providing Suggestions): I understand completely. I used to bottle things up too, but I've learned that the people who love you won't think you're a burden if you ask for help or just to have someone blow off some steam. Changes are definitely scary, but they can also be a great opportunity to do something different. Is there anything you want to try doing? usr: I've always been reluctant to ask for help or favors because i keep thinking there will always be a time down the road where i will need something more. it's helpful to have someone remind me that change isn't always a bad thing. thank you. I'll talk to some friends to see if anyone has some good budget cutting tricks. I'll continue to look for a job and i'll try to calm down a little for now. sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): It sounds like you're very self-aware and I think your friends and family will be very willing to lend a hand. usr: i am aware of many things including how truly fortunate i am to have my family, friends and health.

He argued with her sys(Self-disclosure, Self-disclosure): My husband and I have gone a few times and it really helped having an objective person give us a few tips. We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again. That's too bad that he won't go again. I would still go for yourself. I have gone by myself because I needed extra help. And it's hard to deal with someone who doesn't want to grow and change. usr: I am happy it worked for you :) I just dont see it working with us.

Emotions have a way of wreaking havoc on our bodies. And it sounds like life has been stressful for you lately. Having a physical problem is really hard to deal with in addition to problems in marriage. Do you have any goals set? usr: Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me. The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people. I also have an 8 and 1 year old.

For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time. So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain. I would encourage you to write out some goals and things you want to change about yourself, ideas for you and your children to do. And fight the blues as hard as you can. I find that if I have a list of things I need to do, I can follow that even when I don't feel like it, and sometimes I get out of the slump. usr: It makes total sense. I have tried to do some research and yes work on myself as well. I have done a ton of praying. I do need to make new goals. They help me stay on track, thats for sure. Of course now that I'm home schooling my oldest I'm tearing my hair out there as welll. lol! I always had a huge amount of respect for teachers, but wow! sys(Affirmation and Reassurance, Others): It sounds like you do know good things to do, and that sometimes you need that encouragement and and support.

Why are you freaking out? usr: I think that'll help, yeah sys(Restatement or Paraphrasing): Sometimes just a friend to hear you out and encourage you can really make a difference. Life has its ups and down. usr: I decided to leave my husband, he keeps snapping at me and won't listen to me or let me do anything sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): That's a difficult decision you have made. usr: I'm worried how it'll go though because we have kids sys(Question): Have you tried to talk to him about the problem? Or a counselor? usr: I've tried to talk to him about the control issues, but he doesn't listen. He doesn't know I'm planning to leave and I think he'll try to stop me sys(Self-disclosure): I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave. Do you have a plan in place? usr: I have some leads on apartments and some savings I'm putting aside, and a friend I plan on living with sys(Providing Suggestions): My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes. usr: I haven't got 100% of the details worked out yet, but I'm trying sys(Question): Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive? usr: He hasn't hurt me physically I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory sys(Reflection of feelings): I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling. usr: I think that's the best idea sys(Self-disclosure): Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious. usr: that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend sys(Affirmation and Reassurance): I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet. usr: hey may not realize I'd leave at all me too, that's making all the difference sys(Self-disclosure): My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that. usr: definitely that makes sense sys(Self-disclosure): He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it. usr: I'm not convinced mine loves me, looking back it's beginning to seem like he was draining me for my income and labor sys(Reflection of feelings): Ouch! That sounds painful to look at. usr: it is, I think I was super wrong about him and overlooked red flags sys(Information, Question): People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will ""hear"" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan. How long have you been married? usr: eight years, together for 11 sys(Others, Providing Suggestions): That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two. Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave. usr: absolutely! definitely no paper trail, for sure sys(Providing Suggestions): I believe in the power of prayer too. The Serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what I can, leaving the rest to God. usr: I know that one, it's helping me a lot too sys(Information, Providing Suggestions): If I worry and get upset, then I waste energy, I have had to learn to get distracted if I find myself on that worry train, call a friend, go for a walk, just not obsess, it goes nowhere. And I urge you to get a counselor. usr: that's good advice! I will Thank you",['Others']
